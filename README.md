# React Boilerplate

## Goals
- Server side React rendering
- In development, great debugging experience (live edit React components, fast compiles, simple gulp file, etc)
- In production, best practices for deployment (ugify, gzipped, etc)
- Skeleton for future React projects

## Installation 
```bash
# Install node modules
npm install

# Start development
gulp

# Build assets for production
gulp production

# Start server in production (make sure your config file is set properly)
node index.js
```
