# React Boilerplate

## Goals
- Server side React rendering
- In development, great debugging experience (live edit React components, fast compiles, simple gulp file, etc)
- In production, best practices for deployment (uglify, gzipped, etc)
- Skeleton for future React projects

## Installation 
```bash
# Install node modules
npm install

# Start development
gulp

# Build assets for production
gulp production

# Start server in production
NODE_ENV=production node index.js
```
